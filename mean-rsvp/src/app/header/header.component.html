          <h2>Who we are?</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Scam Protector is an online service and Chrome extension for Gmail that detects social engineering attempts against vulnerable technology users 
            (VTUs), which consists primarily of seniors with age-related mental illness.
          </p>
          <h2>What do we do?</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            As a service, Scam Protect monitors any authenticated gmail acounts for incoming messages that are identified as attempts at social engineering.
          </p>
          <h2>How do we do it?</h2>
          <p class="lead">
              We utilize natural language processing and machine learning to scrub emails of sensitive personal information (i.e. credit/debit card numbers, 
              social security numbers) in order to prevent hostile email senders from scamming VTUs. Once you sign up with a valid email, you can authenticate 
              additional email addresses (including the one used to sign up) to have monitored for social engineering attempts.
